`week08-Cleaning_Data_with_Pandas` was partly integrated into
[week08](https://github.com/scientificprogrammingUOS/lectures/tree/master/week08-Cleaning_and_Analyzing_Data_with_Pandas) of the 2020 lecture.

`week13-Interactive_Data_Analysis_And_Speedups` is part of [week13](https://github.com/scientificprogrammingUOS/lectures/tree/master/week13-Performance-Optimization) in 2020. Not everything was taken over, week 13 also adds some new content.

`week14-StudyAtoZ-Questions` was left out as the semester consisted of only 13 weeks due to the Corona pandemic.
