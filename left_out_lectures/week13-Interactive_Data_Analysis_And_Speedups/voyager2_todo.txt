-mixed-initiative system blending manual and automated chart specification for open-ended and exploration and targeted QA
-wildcards for multiple charts in parallel
-related views recommending charts based on the current focus view
-want smooth transition between open-ended and more focused phases of analysis

---
-upon selection of a dataset, focus view is empty, related view shows univariate summaries for all fields
--- 
usage scenario:
-loading dataset -> familiarize with dataset -> univariate summaries (most cars have even number of cylinders, multiple times the same model name, most of USA, all between 1970-1982, acceleration normally distributed, ..)
-then go to potential associations. -> Drag two quantitative field wildcards to "any" shelves  --> each pair of quanitative fields to x and y axes to make gallery of scatterplots. We see a roughly quadratic relationship between horsepower and miles per gallon, we're interested in that, let's bookmark it with a note, then specify  button to make it focus
-we see now the related views shows eg a 2d-hist, and the   other related views show variants of that with additional stuff. we see relation to cylinders and to the usa. We make the origin-coded view new focus.
-we confim the mean horsepower of usa cars is higher and the mean miles per gallon is lower. When we hover over the specify-button of the first alternative view, we see what we could do different
-now we're wondering how origin affects other characteristics -> clear encoding shelves, origin zu y und quantitative zu x, x mit wildcard functions (none, mean)
-...in the end we export the bookmarks
